# Fundamentals of Programming Course Project

I developed a game where a spider navigates a graph to catch butterflies, implemented using adjacency matrix input via user, BFS for shortest path calculation, and interactive gameplay allowing users to play as both spider and butterflies, visualized through graphical rendering of the graph's state.
